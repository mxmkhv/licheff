            Multidisciplinary designer with 8+ years of professional experience in the fields of user experience, mobile & web design and branding. I’m a self-driven hard worker and a passionate freethinker who is always looking forward to expanding their worldview. Constantly pushing myself to learn and adopt new technologies and find better solutions for everyday products. <br> 
            My professional design journey started with an internship position in an advertising agency based in Sofia, Bulgaria. Working under tight deadlines and pushing my creativity to the limits, I expanded my skills and gained most of my experience. I had the chance to work on all kinds of different projects, including print, digital, social, packaging and a lot of everything. <br>
            I found out I was passionate about creating good-looking websites and understanding the needs of their users. This led me to my current position - a UX designer at Milestone Systems - an international company focusing on IP-based video management products. Currently I’m responsible for creating a unique experience for the mobile application working closely with a whole team of professionals.
