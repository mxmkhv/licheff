title: Konstruktive Real Estate
category: UXUI Design
description: Konstruktive Real Estates is a website aiming to showcase our
  client's projects. The key features of the website include searching for
  properties based on user preferences, booking inspection hours, news about the
  properties and showcasing the projects. I took main part in creating the whole
  UX of the project including wireframes, prototyping in InVision and after
  client's approval turning the UX into UI. Everything was done under the
  competent art direction of Marian Naydenov.
